# RobotArmsClub
This is the group for high-level discussion of the RobotArmsClub / RobotArmsPub infrastructure and components.

Robot Arms Pub is a zine-in-progress that spun off from the [Cyberpunk Futurism chat group](http://exolymph.com/cyberpunk-futurism-chat-group/). The goal is to compile and publish cool art and stories, meet cool people, and expand our community. You don't have to be part of the chat group to participate, although joining the #robotarmsclub channel will be a fast way to meet most of us and keep track of the ideas being workshopped. We will try to document decisions here and treat this repository as the source of truth. [Check out the issues](https://github.com/RobotArmsClub/RobotArmsClub/issues) to see what's going on!

[Way Spurr-Chen](http://wayspurrchen.com/) is the project manager and general point person, unless you have questions related to the zine content, in which case try [Sonya Mann](http://sonyaellenmann.com/) first.
